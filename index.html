        <footer><h3>The digital age, with all these 3D and digital images, is drastically changing our way of seeing things, the same way that the invention of photography changed with way we saw. And for an artist, that’s very interesting. I do think that a lot of my visual solutions are strongly connected with all those ideas. So if you saw the painting, as you described, incorrectly, that’s really cool—that means there are two levels of seeing the work. Even better. </h3>
